        <h3>Question 2.</h3>
        <p><b><u>Answer</u> > You can select HTML elements using DOM by using various methods. Here are some of the most commonly used DOM methods for selecting HTML elements:
            <br>
            1. getElementById(): This method selects an element based on its id attribute.
            <br>
            2. getElementsByClassName(): This method selects elements based on their class name.
            <br>
            3. getElementsByTagName(): This method selects elements based on their tag name.
            <br>
            4. querySelector(): This method selects the first element that matches a CSS selector. 
            <br>
            5. querySelectorAll(): This method selects all elements that match a CSS selector.

        <h3>Question 3.</h3>
        <p><b><u>Answer</u> > Event bubbling is a mechanism in which events are first captured by the innermost element and then propagated or bubbled up through its parent elements, all the way to the outermost element. During this process, each element can perform its own event handling.
